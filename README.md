### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My government name is Anthony, but you can call me Tony

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing the first semester of my senior year! I'm taking 21 credits so it's quite a lot, but it'll be nothing but a peanut
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about a lot. When it comes to my university education, I'm learning about compressible flow, software aided element analysis, computational techniques for aerospace applications, and a few more. In my personal life, I love learning, so I am currently reading a book on sleep (I pretty much exclusively read nonfiction, I like learning about things), and I often read research papers about nutrition, exercise, and general health
- :black_joker: I've got quite a few hobbies:

                - I love watching soccer. I keep up with all world soccer, but my favorite team is Arsenal FC
                - I'm a big Formula One fan. My favorite Constructors Team is Mercedes AMG Petronas 
                - I love lifting and exercising. Lifting is my main form of exercising, however I'm keen on anything to get my blood pumping
                - Snowboarding is my favorite winter sport and is without a doubt superior to skiing
                - I love watching tv shows and films. My favorite movie is Interstellar and my favorite TV show is either Peaky Blinders or Game 
                of Thrones
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on some things that will make me A LOT of money. I want to start some businesses in the future and having partners would help, so if you have capital to start a business, send me a courier pigeon and we can talk about your potential role in one of my businesses
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing that I can think of at the moment, I would say I'm pretty good with what I've got right now, but that will most likely change the closer it gets to December.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything health and nutrition related as that is one of my passions, any general questions about economics or money since I would say that I understand that much more than the average person (not in an egotistical manner, I just read a lot and follow the market), or really anything interesting. I love talking about conspiracy theories (I think there has to have been help from SOMETHING to build the pyramids), so if you have an interesting one, it'll probably catch my eye
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I reserve my phone number for a very select amount of people, so if you need to reach me, my email is most likely the best way. Ideally, it would be my personal or school email, depending on the context of what is discussed in the email I'm sure you can figure out which one would be more appropriate. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have 2!
    - My grandfather helped build the shuttle that sent Yuri Gagarin to space
    - You had approximately a 1 in 10^2.4 million chance of being born in your exact position, never take those odds for granted
